    'Cette armée russe que l'or de l'Angleterre a transportée des extrémités de l'univers, nous allons lui faire
    éprouver le même sort—(le sort de l'armée d'Ulm).' * He remembered these words in Bonaparte's address to his army at
    the beginning of the campaign, and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling of wounded
    pride, and a hope of glory. 'And should there be nothing left but to die?' he thought. 'Well, if need be, I shall do
    ]it no worse than others.'
    * 'That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of
    the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same
    fate—(the fate of the army at Ulm).'

    He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons
    and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and sometimes four abreast. From
    all sides, behind and before, as far as ear could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts and
    gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers,
    orderlies, and officers. All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and
    broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their
    companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and
    bulging sacks. At each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more
    incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped,
    traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers directing the march rode backward and forward
    between the carts. Their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired
    of the possibility of checking this disorder.
    'Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army,' thought Bolkónski, recalling Bilíbin's words.
    Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a
    strange one-horse vehicle, evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something
    between a cart, a cabriolet, and a calèche. A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the
    apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier
    when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of
    transport was beating the soldier who was driving the woman's vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the
    strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she
    leaned out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:
    'Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven's sake... Protect me! What will become of us? I am the wife of
    the doctor of the Seventh Chasseurs.... They won't let us pass, we are left behind and have lost our people...'
    'I'll flatten you into a pancake!' shouted the angry officer to the soldier. 'Turn back with your slut!'
    'Mr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?' screamed the doctor's wife.
    'Kindly let this cart pass. Don't you see it's a woman?' said Prince Andrew riding up to the officer.
    The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the soldier. 'I'll teach you to push on!... Back!'
    'Let them pass, I tell you!' repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his lips.
    'And who are you?' cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy rage, 'who are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I
    am commander here, not you! Go back or I'll flatten you into a pancake,' repeated he. This expression evidently
    pleased him.
    'That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,' came a voice from behind.
    Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless, tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is
    saying. He saw that his championship of the doctor's wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more
    than anything in the world—to ridicule; but his instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence
    Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his riding whip.
    'Kind...ly let—them—pass!'
    The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.
    'It's all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there's this disorder,' he muttered. 'Do as you like.'
